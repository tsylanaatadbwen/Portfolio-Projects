# YouTube Comments Sentiment Analysis: Understanding Viewer Perceptions of the Tesla Cybertruck

## Project Overview
This project involves two main components: Python web scraping for data collection and Power BI for data visualization and analysis.

## 1.Python Web Scraping  
- Utilized Python libraries such as google-api-python-client and Pandas for web scraping and data manipulation.
- Obtained API key credentials from Google Cloud to access the YouTube API for retrieving comments from the review video.
- Developed a Python script to scrape comments, including user information, likes, and timestamps, from the YouTube video.
- Performed data cleaning and transformation tasks, such as removing special characters and duplicates, to prepare the scraped data for analysis.
- Saved the cleaned data to a CSV file for further analysis in Power BI.

## 2.Power BI Report & Dashboard:
- Loaded the cleaned data into Power BI using Power Query for additional data transformation and manipulation.
- Conducted sentiment analysis on the comments using Power BI's AI functions or external text analytics services.
- Created visualizations, such as pie charts and bubble plots, to analyze sentiment distribution, engagement patterns, and sentiment-likes relationships.
- Generated a word cloud visualization to identify key themes and topics of discussion within the comments.
- Implemented slicers and navigation buttons for user interactivity and ease of exploration.
- Interpreted the findings and insights derived from the visualizations to understand viewer sentiments and perceptions of the Tesla Cybertruck.

## Disclaimer
The scraping dataset was created on 23-03-24, ensuring it is updated until then.
