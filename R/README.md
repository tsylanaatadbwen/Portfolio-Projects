## Libraries Used

- The analysis uses the following R libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and cleaning:
  - tidyverse
  - skimr
  - markdown

## Data Loading and Cleaning

The project initiates by loading the dataset and performing the following steps:

1. Viewing the first rows and structure of the dataset.
2. Checking for duplicates.
3. Removing duplicated rows.
4. Basic descriptive statistics and handling missing values.

## Plot Analysis

### Price Distribution

- Visualize the distribution of laptop prices using a histogram.
- The histogram displays a right-skewed distribution with three prominent peaks.

### Brand Analysis - Average Price

- Analyzed the average laptop prices by brand.
- The bar chart reveals brand-specific pricing insights.

### RAM & Price Relationship

- Explored the relationship between RAM and laptop prices using a scatter plot.
- The plot illustrates the correlations between RAM capacity and pricing.

### Storage Type Distribution

- Examined the distribution of storage types among laptops using a pie chart.
- The chart highlights the predominance of SSD storage types.

### Touchscreen vs. Non-Touchscreen Prices

- Compared prices between touchscreen and non-touchscreen laptops with box plots.
- The visualizations offer insights into price differences.

### CPU Analysis - Most Common CPU

- Analyzed the frequency of different CPU types among laptops using a bar chart.
- The chart identifies the most common CPU types.

## Recommendations

This project provides insights and recommendations for various stakeholders in the laptop industry:

- Explore the unique features and specifications of laptops from brands like Razer, Millenium, and MSI, which offer higher-priced options with potential performance benefits.
- For consumers seeking laptops within the $200 to $800 price range, consider laptops with 4GB and 8GB RAM, which are prevalent and offer good value.
- Manufacturers should note the popularity of Intel Core i7 and Core i5 CPUs and consider offering a wider range of laptops featuring these processors.
